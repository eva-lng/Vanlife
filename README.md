# vanlife
Vanlife is an app that serves as a rental site where users can find the perfect travel van for their next road trip adventure or list their own van for rent. It was built using React and React Router as part of the Scrimba Rect Router course.

The project focuses on utilizing React Router features to implement nested routes and provide a smooth Single Page Application (SPA) user experience.

## Lessons Learned:
This project allowed me to expand on my previous experience with React and building SPAs. I became more familiar with React Router, leveraging its extensive features such as route navigation, sorting and filtering with search parameters, using nested routes for shared UI components, protected routes etc. Additionally, I gained experience in utilizing Firebase as a database for storing and fetching data.

## Optimizations:
While this app primarily focuses on frontend development with React and React Router, future optimizations could include following features:
+ User authentication szstem with proper user login and account creation
+ Allow users to add, edit and delete vans from their profile
+ Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for vans
+ Improved layout
